    "    - Sensing date: date the image was taken by the sensor. Ingestion date: date the image was processed to be available.   \n",
    "    - Relative orbit is similar to a \"trail\" that the satellite follows when it circles the Earth. The satellite always follows the same trail (Sentinel satellite takes 143 trails to map the whole Earth from north to south). Path and Row is a method to divide the Earth in different squares. This method is used for Landsat images.   \n",
    "    - DLR archive offers images from sensors like: SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and Terra-SAR-X, among others.  \n",
    "    - For JAXA: see Table A. They are optical and radar sensors, like the ones offered from the USA and European programs.   \n",
    "    - The rasters offered by LDBV (used in this course) are Ortophotos. This images were taken by a camera onboard an airplane or drone. On the other hand, the rasters from Sentinel, are optical imagery taken from a satellite. The radiometric, spatial, temporal resolution and n°bands are completely different. Please see \"properties\" for this.  \n",
